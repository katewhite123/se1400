                <h4>Who is your website's competition?</h4>
                <p>My website's competition is all online clothing and design buisnesses. Some I found were I Hate Music, and then on a bigger scale is a online store called He would Love First.</p>
                <h4>What is something your competing websites do good?</h4>
                <p>Something my competing websites have are main links to all their apparel. This could look like having links at the tops for Women's, Men's and Kid's clothing. <br> Since my target audience is mostly one gender and age group I could divide my site into catagories like T-shirts, Seatshirts, Pants, Hats, and Custom.</p>
                <h4>What is something your competing websites are doing wrong?</h4>
                <p>Clothing websites sometimes do not showcase their clothing in the best way. Organization and presentation are the most important part of selling a product.</p>
                <h4>What is something your website will do better?</h4>
                <p>I want my website to be so organized so that it will showcase my design in the best way.</p>
